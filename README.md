## Course Design

### Course Design Alignment Grid

Fink (2003)
| Learning Outcome <br> (Objectives) | How Learning Will Be Assessed | Teaching / Learning Activity | Resources |
| :---------------------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------: |
| <br><br> |  |  |  |

### Writing Objectives

#### Organization Levels

* University
* College / School
* Program 
* Specialties in Program
* Course
* Lesson 

#### Importance Levels

* "Enduring understanding
  * What do you want students to remember in 5 years?
* Important to know and do
* Worth being familiar with

#### Six Facets of Understanding

* Explain
* Interpret
* Apply
* Perspective
* Empathize
* Self-Knowledge

#### Bloom's Taxonomy

* Evaluation
* Synthesis
* Analysis
* Application
* Comprehension
* Knowledge

You can search online for Bloom's taxonomy and find many figures with descriptive verbs for each level. Those verbs are helpful for writing good objectives.
Updated: https://ctle.utah.edu/instructor-education/Blooms-Taxonomy.php

#### Elements for Course Level Objectives

* Conditions: how, when, where, or with what
* Performance statement: stated with an action verb (refer to Bloom's taxonomy)
* Criterion measure: defines the level of performance and product, process, or outcome

| Level | Condition | Performance | Criterion |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Remember | At the end of class, you will be able to | describe what a pedagogically sound learning objective is | in your own words. |
| Understand | At the end of the lesson, you will be able to | express | the differences between quantitative and qualitative research methods. |
| Apply | By the end of the semester, each person will be able to | calculate formulas and sketch a graph | utilizing the practices introduced in class and in the textbook. |
| Analyze | During the lesson, you will | dissect learning objectives | by color-coding the 3 main elements of conditions, performance, and criterion. |
| Evaluate | You will | critique a classmate's public speaking skills | by considering whether they conform to specifications outlined in our course textbook. |
| Create | By the end of the training, we will be able to | formulate | a pedagogically sound learning objective. |

### Assessment and Evaluation

"Useful assessment generates data about what students know and do, rather than merely identifying student weaknesses." - (Turner, 2014)

#### Four Types of Evidence

* Diagnostic
* Formative
  * 56 ways to gather evidence of student achievement - https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Documents/CDL%20Digital%20Toolkit/Gathering%20Evidence%20of%20Student%20Achievement.pdf
  * Embedded Formative Assessment - Dylan Wiliam
  * Pre-class quizzes
  * Pre-work for inclass activities
  * Games, cahoot
  * Case studies
  * Jam board
  * White board
  * Comprehension questions
  * Entry tickets to class (activities before class)
  * Exit ticket to class (something to accomplish during the class to turn in on the way out, work in small groups)
  * Student response systems (clickers)
  * Cards with scratch off answers (take on own, or as a group) Amy, I think these are what we use for the TBL scratch cards? https://learntbl.ca/if-at-immediate-feedback-assessment-technique/
  * Digital learning - card pack available at the book store (Main book store) A lot of activity ideas
* Evaluative
  * Completed after the work is done. (Assess student learning.)
  * Oral presentations
  * Multiple choice tests
  * Writing
  * Case study presentations
  * Group presentations
  * Final project, create a game, something that is built
  * Skills evaluation
* Summative
  * May overlap with evaluative
  * Dissertations
  * Scholarly projects
  * Assessments
  * Portfolio

### Presenting Information (Teaching)

* Elaborate
* Relate to students' lives
* Activate background knowledge
* Return to big concepts
* Interleave related concepts
* Give multiple examples*
  * Children did better on task they practiced under different circumstances.
  * Similarities and differences help students to understand concept better.
* Begin with a recap
* Use relevant images + limited text*
  * Pair relevant images with speech
  * dual coding - auditory and visual channels can process at the same time
  * memory is better when using dual coding
  * reading requires both channels so not effective on presentation slides
  * limit the amount of text
  * reuse representative images
* Provide agendas & previews
* Share the purpose
* Pause longer
* Stoke curiosity*
  * Memory enhances when brain in curious state. (related and unrelated information)
  * Curiosity related to activity in brain areas dedicated to reward and memory (Gruber, Gelman, Ranganath, 2014) (Kang et al., 2009)
  * Curiosity piqued for surprising answers.
  * Curiosity piqued for high-confidence errors.
  * Have students predict something.
  * Students spend more resources to learn something they're curious about.

### Teaching wth Transparency

* High impact practices
* Transparency in Learning and Teaching Resources https://tilthighered.com/tiltexamplesandresources
* Predictors of success
  * Academic confidence (self efficacy)
  * Sense of belonging
  * Awareness of mastery of skills that employers value most when hiring
* Better student retention

#### Transparent Assignments

* Purpose
  * Discuss purpose of assignment ahead of time
  * Discuss skills that will be practiced
  * Discuss knowledge that will be gained from the assignment
  * Discuss how skills and knowledge will relate to real lives
* Tasks
  * Outline what the expectations are for the assignments
  * Outline how it should be done
  * recommended sequence
  * mistakes to avoid
  * Doing this will allow more time to be spent on the task at hand
* Criteria for Success
  * Checklist of expectations
  * Examples of completed work (good and bad)

### Active Learning

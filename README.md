## Course Design

### Course Design Alignment Grid

Fink (2003)
| Learning Outcome <br> (Objectives) | How Learning Will Be Assessed | Teaching / Learning Activity | Resources |
| :---------------------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------: |
| <br><br> |  |  |  |

### Writing Objectives

#### Organization Levels

* University
* College / School
* Program 
* Specialties in Program
* Course
* Lesson 

#### Importance Levels

* "Enduring understanding
  * What do you want students to remember in 5 years?
* Important to know and do
* Worth being familiar with

#### Six Facets of Understanding

* Explain
* Interpret
* Apply
* Perspective
* Empathize
* Self-Knowledge

#### Bloom's Taxonomy

* Evaluation
* Synthesis
* Analysis
* Application
* Comprehension
* Knowledge

You can search online for Bloom's taxonomy and find many figures with descriptive verbs for each level. Those verbs are helpful for writing good objectives.

#### Elements for Course Level Objectives

* Conditions: how, when, where, or with what
* Performance statement: stated with an action verb (refer to Bloom's taxonomy)
* Criterion measure: defines the level of performance and product, process, or outcome

| Level | Condition | Performance | Criterion |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Remember | At the end of class, you will be able to | describe what a pedagogically sound learning objective is | in your own words. |
| Understand | At the end of the lesson, you will be able to | express | the differences between quantitative and qualitative research methods. |
| Apply | By the end of the semester, each person will be able to | calculate formulas and sketch a graph | utilizing the practices introduced in class and in the textbook. |
| Analyze | During the lesson, you will | dissect learning objectives | by color-coding the 3 main elements of conditions, performance, and criterion. |
| Evaluate | You will | critique a classmate's public speaking skills | by considering whether they conform to specifications outlined in our course textbook. |
| Create | By the end of the training, we will be able to | formulate | a pedagogically sound learning objective. |

### Assessment and Evaluation

"Useful assessment generates data about what students know and do, rather than merely identifying student weaknesses." - (Turner, 2014)

#### Four Types of Evidence

* Diagnostic
* Formative
  * 56 ways to gather evidence of student achievement - https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Documents/CDL%20Digital%20Toolkit/Gathering%20Evidence%20of%20Student%20Achievement.pdf
  * Embedded Formative Assessment - Dylan Wiliam
  * Pre-class quizzes
  * Pre-work for inclass activities
		* Games, cahoot
		* Case studies
		* Jam board
		* White board
		* Comprehension questions
		* Entry tickets to class (activities before class)
		* Exit ticket to class (something to accomplish during the class to turn in on the way out, work in small groups)
		* Student response systems (clickers)
		* Cards with scratch off answers (take on own, or as a group) Amy, I think these are what we use for the TBL scratch cards? https://learntbl.ca/if-at-immediate-feedback-assessment-technique/
  * Digital learning - card pack available at the book store (Main book store) A lot of activity ideas
* Evaluative
  * Completed after the work is done. (Assess student learning.)
		* Oral presentations
		* Multiple choice tests
		* Writing
		* Case study presentations
		* Group presentations
		* Final project, create a game, something that is built
  * Skills evaluation
* Summative
  * May overlap with evaluative
  * Dissertations
  * Scholarly projects
  * Assessments
  * Portfolio

## Learning Activity Ideas

### Quizzes

* Quizzes on reading (before or after)
* Prequiz
* Question banks for variable quizzes
* Timed quizes
* Limited or unlimeted attempts on quizzes
* Quiz scavenger hunt

### Study Guides

* Base study guides/tests on course objectives
* Provide study guides before lectures/reading

### Grading Rubrics

* Create grading rubrics for assignments

### Optional Material

* Keep required and optional (additional) material in separate sections

### Communication

* Communicate objectives up front
* Communicate structure up front
* Communicate challenges up front

### Discussions

* Mind mapping
* Ask a question/Answer a question

## University of Utah Course Resources

* University of Utah Teaching and Learning Technologies https://tlt.utah.edu/
* Syllabus template and checklist https://ctle.utah.edu/instructor-education/syllabus.php
  * The template gets updated regularly, so this is a good resource to check against each semester to see if there are any changes.
  * A lot of good elements to make the syllabus inclusive.
* Canvas Commons - search for University of Utah common
  * You can import multiple templates.
  * The syllabus section gets overwritten, so import the template with the syllabus style you want last.
